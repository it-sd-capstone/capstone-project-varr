Welcome! This is our final release of Varr Dungeon.
As per our pitch, we want to...
Bring retro gaming back. This will be in an old school text-based dungeon
crawling game using timeless RPG components like defeating monsters to collect valuable loot
and experience points to increase your characterâ€™s power. Your character power will determine
your fate. If you are too weak the dungeon will eat you up and split out, but if you are powerful
enough your name will be written in the heavens!!

- We also were able to easily change any enemy stats to test out our leveling system
